> Generate a changelog from git metadata

You are probably looking for the [cli](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-cli) module. Or use one of the plugins if you are already using the tool:  [grunt](https://github.com/btford/grunt-conventional-changelog)/[gulp](https://github.com/stevemao/gulp-conventional-changelog)/[atom](https://github.com/stevemao/atom-conventional-changelog).


## Usage

```sh
$ npm install --save conventional-changelog
```

```js
var conventionalChangelog = require('conventional-changelog');

conventionalChangelog({
  preset: 'angular'
})
  .pipe(process.stdout); // or any writable stream
```


## API

### conventionalChangelog([options, [context, [gitRawCommitsOpts, [parserOpts, [writerOpts]]]]])

Returns a readable stream.

#### options

See the [conventional-changelog-core](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-core) docs. The API is exactly the same with some additions:

##### preset

Type: `string` Possible values: `'angular', 'atom', 'codemirror', 'ember', 'eslint', 'express', 'jquery', 'jscs', 'jshint'`

It's recommended to use a preset so you don't have to define everything yourself. The preset values can be overwritten. This value is case insensitive.


## Notes for parent modules

This module has options `append` and `releaseCount`. However, it doesn't read your previous changelog. Reasons being:

1. The old logs is just to be appended or prepended to the newly generated logs, which is a very simple thing that could be done in the parent module.
2. We want it to be very flexible for the parent module. You could create a readable stream from the file or you could just read the file.
3. We want the duty of this module to be very minimum.

So, when you build a parent module, you need to read the old logs and append or prepend to them based on `options.append`. However, if `options.releaseCount` is `0` you need to ignore any previous logs.
