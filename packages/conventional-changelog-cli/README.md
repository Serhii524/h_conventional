> Generate a changelog from git metadata


## Quick start

```sh
$ npm install -g conventional-changelog-cli
$ cd my-project
$ conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -w
```

This will *not* overwrite any previous changelog. The above generates a changelog based on commits since the last semver tag that match the pattern of a "Feature", "Fix", "Performance Improvement" or "Breaking Changes".

If you first time use this tool and want to generate all previous changelog, you could do

```sh
$ conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -w -r 0
```

This *will* overwrite any previous changelog if exist.

All available command line parameters can be listed using [CLI](#cli) : `conventional-changelog --help`.

**Hint:** You can alias your command or add it to your package.json. EG: `"changelog": "conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -w -r 0"`.


## Recommended workflow

1. Make changes
2. Commit those changes
3. Make sure Travis turns green
4. Bump version in `package.json`
5. `conventionalChangelog`
6. Commit `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` files
7. Tag
8. Push


The reason why you should commit and tag after `conventionalChangelog` is that the CHANGELOG should be included in the new release, hence `gitRawCommitsOpts.from` defaults to the latest semver tag.

## Example output

- https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
- https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
- https://github.com/btford/grunt-conventional-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md


## Why

- Used by AngularJS and related projects.
- Ignoring reverted commits, templating with [handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) and links to references, etc. Open an [issue](../../issues/new) if you want more reasonable features.
- Intelligently setup defaults but yet fully configurable with presets of popular projects.
- Everything internally or externally is pluggable.
- A lot of tests and actively maintained.
